% On Camus and The Absurd
28 Apr 2021

I am interested in the intersection of Absurdist and Existentialist philosophy. So much so that I got a tattoo, which I designed, symbolizing the Myth of Sisyphus. I think it was a case of receiving just the right message at just the right time. This past summer has been a very formative experience, and reading the works of Albert Camus kept me afloat in many ways.

This post will serve as a revisiting of the philosophy that inspired me and as a chance to formalize my ideas surrounding them with words.

At the heart of it, it is the acceptance that your life, the lives of others, and the world you live in are all finite. It is the acceptance that you are playing a game where you a free to make up the rules; there are no judgemental referees. It is the acceptance that there is no inherent meaning to be found in the universe other than what you make yourself, and even then, time will take that away as well.

Camus is right in that the Absurd exists and is waiting to meet any human gaze with cold indifference and that that is the primary relation between the conscious man and the universe.
As stated by Werner Herzog "The universe is monstrously indifferent to the existence of man."

I wonder, however, how science and mathematics factor into that relationship. The world contains structures and patterns that can be studied and marveled at. In my case, my natural infatuation with all things relating to computing

I disagree that to ponder that there are divine planes beyond the human experience is to admit *Philosophical Suicide*. Camus asserts that he shouldn't worry about things outside of what he can reason about as a man.
I can see this being valid from a pragmatic view, but I don't think that it invalidates theology, old or new.

Should I play Don Juan? Do I chase after this woman I've just met?
What will become of it? Of us?
I think that at present, I should not. But the future looks bright.
