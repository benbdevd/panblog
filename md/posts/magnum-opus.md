% Dealing with Monsters - My Magnum Opus
20 Jul 2020

This is my life's work so far; the best I can muster.
On Facebook, [I publicly opened up about darkness in my past](https://www.facebook.com/flottolika/posts/3507687969246894), and reached out through the screen to anyone that would listen; I do that again now.

Specifically, I harbored racist ideology during middle school. I picked it up on the internet where people shared skewed perspectives on American "Black Crime Statistics".
The people who subscribe to that line of thinking like to think that these stats prove that Black people are uncivilized apes and that there is no helping them.
They think that Black people are doomed to their current fate and any attempt to help their situation is not only futile, but an attempt to wreak havoc by an international Jewish conspiracy.

Some would call them the Alt-Right, Neo Nazis, White Supremacists. But to be honest, they don't really go by a name.
They have been so far repressed and rejected from the public that they don't even really have a name to call themselves, nor would they want one.

And that is unfortunate in my opinion, because it makes it more difficult to do anything about it.
How can you confront something you cannot name and doesn't want to come out of the dark?

The term White fragility is thrown around, but it is a misnomer.
There are self-hating Jewish and Black people in these groups; they struggle with their own identity and "accept" that their people are inferior.
The real issue is "fragility" or insecurity, fear, and distrust in general.

They are not for or against a specfic political party.
Originally they supported Donald Trump, but when Trump made kind gestures to Israel and he didn't build the wall, they rejected him and mocked MAGA with MIGA (Make Israel Great Again), to suggest that he was now in on the supposed conspiracy.

They don't have a united community or meeting place: /pol/, /r9k/, Wiz Chan, Discord.
They are only united under fear and hatred. They truly are the [Elliot Rodgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Isla_Vista_killings), [Brenton Tarrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings), and [Dylan Kleybolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre) waiting to happen.

The key thing to remember though is that we are all human, and these people don't have to become homicidal monsters.
And I say people, because [there was a girl who shot up YouTube HQ in 2018; Nasim Najafi Aghdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_headquarters_shooting).

I confronted these "monsters" on by going to a private Facebook group of 600+ members and posting an honest warning.
I was expecting to get kicked/banned immediately; I'm happy to say that did not happen.
