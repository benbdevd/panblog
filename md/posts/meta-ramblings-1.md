I am working on two blog posts at the moment. I am not sure if I will be able to polish them to a level I am happy with for a while. In the meantime, I thought I would indulge in a few thoughts.

# Something Substantial

I think about what my impact will be in the final analysis. I worry that it won't amount to much by any measure.

With my limited skills considered, I figure writing is my best option, that or raising children. Whether it be writing in English or in a programming language, writing is the most efficient way for me to impact the world.

I feel a need to do something beyond pushing minor commits to enterprise software that greases the gears of our current economic system.

I have a love for cinema and music, but I don't think I'll be able to achieve anything of note in those areas given my current skill level and the unlikeliness that I will improve substantially. I still hope to make some fun projects here and there.

I want to find an open-source project and contribute to it. My first pick would be FFmpeg because of my love of video, the fun I've had working with it, and the desire to further improve an amazing piece of free (as in free speech) software. I worry that the code and theory are above me, and I won't be able to make a meaningful contribution to it, but surely I can do something of value.

# Something Warm

Sometimes I feel like I went for a spacewalk and got detached from the spacecraft, never to interact with anyone ever again. Realistically, this isn't and has never been true, but it's cold comfort when loneliness stares you in the face.
