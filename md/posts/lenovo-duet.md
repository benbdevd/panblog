So, I bought my first Chromebook; a Lenovo Duet. It's a pretty unique product. It's an ARM based convertible tablet with an included kickstand and keyboard. It has only a single USB-C port for charging. It runs ChromeOS, but it also runs Android apps and Linux apps through an automagic virtual machine. It has USI pen support. I bought two compatible pens. The pen performance is acceptable; palm rejection is non-existant and quite annoying at times.

It does not have the most performant CPU when managing lots of windows and tabs. Sometimes it gets overwhelmed and the main browser process crashes, effectively restarting every app I had open.

With the way I used to update my website (building the site locally and committing the changes), I couldn't update my website from my Duet because the version of pandoc supplied in the Debian repository was outdated and missing a feature that I used extensively.

Now, I have updated my site workflow to use GitHub Actions so my site automatically builds whenever I commit a change. I can now happily update my site using my Duet (I'm using it to write this post).

My ownership of this device has been an experiment into how effective I can be with a very stripped down computer. 9 times out of 10, when it actually came to getting work done, I didn't feel limited by the Duet.

I am able to program in C and Python in VSCode. I was able to run machine learning workloads in the browser via Google Colab. It is surprising how much you can do in the browser so long as you have an internet connection.
