<h1 class="title">On Camus and The Absurd</h1>
</header>
<p>10 May 2021</p>
<p><img src="./images/sisyphus.png" /></p>
<p>I am interested in the intersection of Absurdist and Existentialist philosophy. So much so that I got a tattoo, which I designed, symbolizing Sisyphus and his eternal struggle. I think it was a case of receiving just the right message at just the right time. This past summer has been a very formative experience, and reading the works of Albert Camus kept me afloat in many ways.</p>
<p><img src="./images/sisyphus_tattoo.jpg" /></p>
<p>This post will serve as a revisiting of the philosophy that inspired me and as a chance to formalize my ideas surrounding it with words.</p>
<p>I read both <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> (1955), and <em>The Stranger</em> (1942). While <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> was a much denser read, I feel I actually got a lot more of the philosophical ideas presented, while I found the entire contents of <em>The Stranger</em> can be summed up the first few sections of <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-absurdism">Summary of Absurdism</h2>
<p>I will start by summarizing what I have gathered from my cursory study of the philosophy.</p>
<p>Absurdism is the acceptance that your life, the lives of others, and the world you live in are all finite; the realization and acceptance that you are playing a game where you a free to make up the rules; there are no judgemental referees. There is no inherent meaning to be found in the universe, only what you make yourself, and even then, time will take that away as well.</p>
<h3 id="defining-the-absurd">Defining <strong>The Absurd</strong></h3>
<p>The Absurd is the relationship and constant tension between the universe, devoid of inherent meaning, and humans, conscious creatures that constantly seek meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Absurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their confrontation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Camus enumerates many of the feelings and consequences of The Absurd to try and get at the heart of it. It is the problem that a conscious man is faced with upon his disillusion. The discovery of it produces the kind of existential questioning we are interested in.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-myth-of-sisyphus">On <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em></h2>
<p>Taken from the preface of <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> poses mortal problems, it sums itself up for me as a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the very midst of the desert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This interpretation is very much inline with my own. I felt very alone this past summer for a myriad of reasons; I found myself in a desert more than once. Reading this book inspired me to make the most out of every moment, to bathe in the summer sun before winter could take it away, to chase after many mates as a virile male, a <strong><em>Don Juan</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the argumentation in <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> deals with the problem of suicide, the refutation of contemporary philosohpies, and laying out what it means to be an Absurd man and create Absurd art.</p>
<p>When faced with the realization that there is no inherent meaning to your existence and that everything you know will eventually be obliterated, it is natural to wonder “Why not just quit now?”</p>
<p>But to end your existence short is to deny yourself the opportunity to rebel in the face of The Absurd, to play the game on your own terms. I will expand on this in the next subsection.</p>
<p>The level of acceptance required to be an Absurd man is complete. It is to live <em>without appeal</em>, without clinging to hope.</p>
<h3 id="suicide">Suicide</h3>
<h3 id="philosophical-suicide">Philosophical Suicide</h3>
<p>Camus argues that competing theistic philosophies commit <em>Philosophical Suicide</em>, a sort of throwing up your hands at attempting to reason and just leave at “it must be divine”.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly where I stand on this point. I think that it is permissible to theorize about divine planes beyond our own, but perhaps believing that there must exist some divine being is where the <em>Philosophical Suicide</em> comes in.</p>
<h2 id="exploration-and-extension">Exploration and Extension</h2>
<p>I think that Camus’ perspective may have been limited by his focus on contemporary philosophy and the decades between our existences. I would like to extend and question Absurdism the up-to-date state of affairs as a human on this Earth.</p>
<h3 id="mathematics-and-science">Mathematics and Science</h3>
<p>Firstly, I wonder how mathematics and science factor into the relationship between humans and the universe, The Absurd. The world contains structures and patterns that can be studied, reasoned about, and marveled at.</p>
