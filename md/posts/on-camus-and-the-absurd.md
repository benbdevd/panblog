% On Camus and The Absurd
4 Mar 2021

Camus posits that upon breaking the habitual chain of human trivial, there can only be two outcome; suicide or recovery. On this I agree.

I disagree that to accept that there are divine planes beyond the human experience is to admit Philosophical Suicide.

Camus' is right in that the Absurd exists and is waiting to meet any human gaze with cold indifference and that that is the primary relation between the conscious man and the universe.
As stated by Werner Herzog "The universe is monstrously indifferent to the existence of man."

His relation of the Human struggle to the myth of Sisyphus is a just one, however it is not the end of the story for me at least.
In this myth, Sisyphus is ordained by the Gods to eternal torment by the repetitive fruitless labor of pushing a boulder up a hill repeatedly.
When relating to the Human condition, it should be noted that the majority of human suffering and torment is not ordained by God but by other humans. It is here where I differ from Camus I believe.

He characterizes the Human Experience as a lonesome one and where relationships do not hold any special value. I object that relationships are the value and that it is placing Good Faith and trust in your fellow man that is the divine truth/objective that makes the pointless and Absurdity of the human condition not only tolerable but completely surpasses it in meaning.

To become a Good Father is the highest order achievable. That is why the relationship of God to Jesus is highlighted. Jesus is tormented by the Absurd and the injustice he is faced with on the cross. And like Camus would suggest, he accepts his torture and place on the cross. What then happens is he transcends Human existence. This is the transition from boy to man, son to father, human to deity.

The Absurd actor does complete life in the time of a performance where the audience member does not.

Synecdoche New York: The real devastation comes from us the audience knowing that you the young actor playing Willy Loman will also end up in that terrible desolation.

Should I play Don Juan? Do I chase after this woman I've just met?
What will become of it? Of us?
I think that at present, I should not. But the future looks bright.
