% On Camus and The Absurd
10 May 2021

I am interested in the intersection of Absurdist and Existentialist philosophy. So much so that I got a tattoo, which I designed, symbolizing the Myth of Sisyphus. I think it was a case of receiving just the right message at just the right time. This past summer has been a very formative experience, and reading the works of Albert Camus kept me afloat in many ways.

This post will serve as a revisiting of the philosophy that inspired me and as a chance to formalize my ideas surrounding them with words.

I read both *The Myth of Sisyphus* (1955), and *The Stranger* (1942). While *The Myth of Sisyphus* was a much denser read, I feel I actually distilled a lot of the philosophical ideas presented, while I found the entire contents of *The Stranger* can be summed up the first few sections of *The Myth of Sisyphus*.
I believe this is because it was written later and Camus was able to develop his ideas and presentation in this more to-the-point essay.

## Summary of Absurdism

I will start by summarizing what I have gathered from my cursory study of the philosophy.

It is the acceptance that your life, the lives of others, and the world you live in are all finite. You are playing a game where you a free to make up the rules; there are no judgemental referees. There is no inherent meaning to be found in the universe other than what you make yourself, and even then, time will take that away as well.

## On *The Myth of Sisyphus*

Taken from the preface of *The Myth of Sisyphus*:

> Although *The Myth of Sisyphus* poses mortal problems, it sums itself up for me as a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the very midst of the desert.

This interpretation is very much inline with my own. I felt very alone this past summer for a myriad of reasons; I found myself in a desert more than once. Reading this book inspired me to make the most out of every moment, to bathe in the summer sun before winter could take it away, to chase after many mates as a virile male, a ***Don Juan***.

Fundamentally, the argumentation in *The Myth of Sisyphus* is dealing with the question of suicide. The ultimate decision. When faced with the realization that there is no inherent meaning to your existence and that everything you know will eventually be obliterated, it is natural to wonder "Why not just quit now?"

## Updating Exploration

I believe Camus is right in that the Absurd exists and is waiting to meet any human gaze with cold indifference and that that is the primary relation between the conscious man and the universe.
As stated by Werner Herzog "The universe is monstrously indifferent to the existence of man."

I wonder how science and mathematics factor into that relationship. The world contains structures and patterns that can be studied and marveled at. In my case, my natural infatuation with all things relating to computing certainly feels meaningful.
