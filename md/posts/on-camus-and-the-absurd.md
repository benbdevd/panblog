% On Camus and The Absurd
10 May 2021

I am interested in the intersection of Absurdist and Existentialist philosophy. So much so that I got a tattoo, which I designed, symbolizing Sisyphus and his eternal struggle. I think it was a case of receiving just the right message at just the right time. This past summer has been a very formative experience, and reading the works of Albert Camus kept me afloat in many ways.

This post will serve as a revisiting of the philosophy that inspired me and as a chance to formalize my ideas surrounding it with words.

I read both *The Myth of Sisyphus* (1955), and *The Stranger* (1942). While *The Myth of Sisyphus* was a much denser read, I feel I actually distilled a lot of the philosophical ideas presented, while I found the entire contents of *The Stranger* can be summed up the first few sections of *The Myth of Sisyphus*.
I believe this is because it was written later and Camus was able to develop his ideas and presentation in this more to-the-point essay.

## Summary of Absurdism

I will start by summarizing what I have gathered from my cursory study of the philosophy.

Absurdism is the acceptance that your life, the lives of others, and the world you live in are all finite. You are playing a game where you a free to make up the rules; there are no judgemental referees. There is no inherent meaning to be found in the universe other than what you make yourself, and even then, time will take that away as well.

The Absurd is the relationship and constant tension between the universe, devoid of inherent meaning, and humans, conscious creatures that impose meaning at every level.
The Absurd is the acknowledgement that while we hope for a better tomorrow, tomorrow always means one day closer to ultimate death.
As stated by Werner Herzog "The universe is monstrously indifferent to the existence of man."

> The absurd is essentially a divorce. It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their confrontation.

## On *The Myth of Sisyphus*

Taken from the preface of *The Myth of Sisyphus*:

> Although *The Myth of Sisyphus* poses mortal problems, it sums itself up for me as a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the very midst of the desert.

This interpretation is very much inline with my own. I felt very alone this past summer for a myriad of reasons; I found myself in a desert more than once. Reading this book inspired me to make the most out of every moment, to bathe in the summer sun before winter could take it away, to chase after many mates as a virile male, a ***Don Juan***.

Fundamentally, the argumentation in *The Myth of Sisyphus* deals with the problem of suicide, the refutation of contemporary philosohpies, and laying out what it means to be an Absurd man and create Absurd art.

> It happens that the stage sets collapse. Rising, streetcar four hours in the office or at the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, cleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Freiday and Saturday according to the same rhythm - this path is easily followed most of the time.

When faced with the realization that there is no inherent meaning to your existence and that everything you know will eventually be obliterated, it is natural to wonder "Why not just quit now?"

But to end your existence short is to deny yourself the opportunity to rebel in the face of The Absurd, to play the game with your own rules anyway.

The level of acceptance required to be an Absurd man is complete. It is to live *without appeal*, without clinging to hope.

### Philosophical Suicide



## Exploration and Extension

I think that Camus' perspective may have been limited by his focus on contemporary philosophy and the decades in-between our existences.
I would like to extend and question Absurdism the up-to-date state of affairs as a human on this Earth.

### Mathematics and Science

Firstly, I wonder how science and mathematics factor into the relationship between humans and The Absurd.
The world contains structures and patterns that can be studied and marveled at. In my case, my infatuation with all things relating to computing certainly feels meaningful. 

In the case of mathematics, there exist a world of relationships, structures, and theorems unto its own, completely independent of the physical world. 



### Transhumanism
